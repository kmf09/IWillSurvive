It probably won't kill me to not purify it.

If it's good enough for the animals, it's good enough to me.

I shouldn't drink the water.

As long as I avoid the animal fur and dander, I'll be ok.
2
I'll build a face mask to control dander.

Good! I can catch some water.

I should find shelter in case it turns out to be a bad storm.
3
I can read clouds pretty well; I'm not worried.
4
I wouldn't know with all these trees.

I'll place it by the fire; the animals will avoid that area.
