You find signs of animals in the area. How do you find them?
I let them come to me.
1
I find a hospitable place and wait.
4
I wander because I don't have a lot of hunting skills.
2
I can track like a bloodhound and do so!
3@You finally meet your prey. How do you take them down?
I have a knife and a stick. What more do I need?
3
I can build snares and traps.
4
I don't catch animals; I'm a vegetarian.
1
I try to scavenge instead.
2@What sort of animals do you prepare to encounter?
Some sheep and maybe a few deer
3
Birds of prey mostly.
2
Snakes, rats, lizards, and other such things.
3
I ignore them. The food in my pack is plenty.
1@There's some vegetation! Do you forage for food?
I wouldn't. A lot of them are probably low in nutrients or toxic.
1
There isn't enough to live off of. I'll focus on something else.
3
I know too little to risk eating anything.
2
I know enough, and try to eat as much as I can.
4@The desert is a hostile place. What do you do for shelter?
I use the thick, water proof tarp in my pack to build a fort.
4
I try and find some natural shelter.
2
I start swinging at cacti with my knife so that I can build one!
1
There is little hope for shelter, so I use the energy to finding more water.
3@Your pack sure is heavy! What can be discarded?
Plastic whistle
3
Compressed trioxide fuel 
2
Magnetic compass 
1
Insect headnet
4@The sun's going down! What do you burn to light up the night?
What about that stuff from my pack I just threw away? 
3
I use cactus, since it's a desert there aren't any real trees.
2
I burn whatever I didn't eat for dinner.
4
I don't build a fire. it's too hot!
1@Cacti are sharp! Do you break out the first aid?
Yes, after I finish crying
1
It could get infected. I treat it to be safe.
4
Nah, I don't think many cacti are that harmful to begin with.
3
If by first aid you mean rubbing some dirt in it, then yes!
2@Are you going in circles? The night stars plot a map for you!
It gets cold at night. I don't want to be moving around!
1
Forget the cold...what about the wildlife!?
2
I'm better off cold than hot! I'll risk my limited knowledge of the north star.
3
I use to map stars as a child.
4@The sun just won't quit! What do you do about the burn?
I'm fine with risking skin cancer. I need to be searching for water!
2
That's why I hide under my shelter all day!
3
There are some plants which provide cover.
1
With my packs supplies, I protect myself from the sun.
4@Is that a real Aloe Vera plant? You have some injuries to treat, after all...
That's a fabricated chemical. It doesn't really do anything!
Yep, I used to grow them in my backyard!
4
It doesn't matter because I found a creosote bush!
2
Everyone knows the Opuntia plant is a panacea!
2@You're parched! What do you do for quick water?
I cut open a cactus and drain water from there.
3
I find some food. Desert animals are thick in water!
2
I make a solar still.
4
I dig a hole. There's probably a high water table.
1@What's that thing with the curled up tail?
It's probably just a beetle.
1
Let's get closer, 'red and yellow kills a fellow!' 
2
Doesn't matter. I ran away already!
3
That's a scorpion, but it's easy to avoid.
4@The scorpion got you. What do you do?
Scream, "I'm going to die!"
1
I realize I'm bigger than a snake, so I'll be alright.
3
I probably have some sort of anti-venom in my pack for such an occasion.
4
I suck the venom out.
