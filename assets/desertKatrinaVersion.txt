How will you locate animals?
I let them come to me.
1
I plan on finding a hospitable place and waiting.
4
I'll wander because I don't have a lot of hunting skills.
2
I can track like a bloodhound.
3@ability to catch animals in the wild
I have a knife and a stick, I don't need any more.
3
I can build snares and traps.
4
I don't catch animals, I'm a vegetarian.
1
I will scavenge.
2@You're going hunting', what sort of animals do you expect to find?
some sheep , maybe a few deer.
3
birds of prey.
2
snakes, rats, lizards, and other gross things.
3
I've got some stuff in my pack I'll live off of. 
1@which plants would you eat? 
I wouldn't; a lot of them are low in nutrients or toxic.
1
there aren't enough plants, I'll focus on something else. 
3
I have no knowledge of plants I wouldn't eat any. 
2
I know a bit, I'd try to eat as many as I could. 
4@You're on your own for shelter. What do you do?
Use the thick ( and water proof ) tarp in your pack to build a fort.
4
Try and find some shelter. 
2
Start swinging at cacti with your knife until you can build one. 
1
There is no hope for shelter, use the energy on finding water.
3@your pack is heavy and not entirely useful. What is least important and can be discarded?
plastic whistle.
3
compressed trioxide fuel.
2
magnetic compass. 
1
insect headnet.
4@what would you use for firewood?
That stuff I just threw out of my pack. 
3
A cactus, since it's a desert there aren't any real trees. 
2
Whatever I didn't eat for dinner. 
4
I wouldn't build a fire, it's hot. 
1@Cacti are sharp! Will you suck up that flesh wound and rub some dirt in it or pull out the first aid?
Yes, after I finish crying.
1
It could get infected, it's good to be safe. 
4
Nah, I don't think many cacti are that harmful.  
3
If by first aid you mean rubbing some dirt in it then yes. 
2@The dessert is sparse in life in general how well can you navigate with a compass/stars?
It get's cold at night, you don't want to be moving around.
1
Forget the cold and worry about the wildlife. 
2
Better cold than hot I'll risk my limited knowledge of the north star. 
3
I know enough to conquer a Jeopardy category. 
4@I hope you brought some sunscreen or at least not a ginger.
I'm fine with getting skin cancer, I need to be searching for water. 
2
That's why I'm hiding under my shelter all day. 
3
There are some plants which provide a canopy. 
1
With my packs supplies I can be protected from the sun.
4@Can you recognize that Aloe Vera without the fancy supermarket bottle? what about other plants?
I thought that was a fabricated chemical.
1
Yep, I used to grow them in my backyard . 
4
Doesn't matter I found a creosote bush.
2
Everyone knows the Opuntia plant can cure almost anything.
2@It's been a while since you've had water, aren't you thirsty?
Cut open a cactus.
3
Find some food, desert animals are thick in water. 
2
Make a solar still. 
4
Dig a hole, there's a high water table. 
1@Is that a scorpion?
Where? I can't recognize venomous creatures. 
1
Let's get closer, 'red and yellow kills a fellow'. 
2
To late, I ran away.
3
Yes, but I can avoid them. 
4@The scorpion got you. What is your immediate thought?
I'm going to die.
1
I'm bigger than a snake, I'll be alright.
3
I might have something for this in my pack.
4
I'll suck the venom out.
